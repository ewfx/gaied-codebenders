## 💡 Inspiration
This project was inspired by the need for efficient automation and AI-powered solutions in hackathon environments. Given our experience in Python development, DevOps, and automation, we wanted to build a scalable system that streamlines complex tasks like data validation, backend processing, and deployment automation.

## ⚙️ What It Does
This project is an AI-powered email classification system that categorises incoming emails based on their content. It uses machine learning to automate sorting, improve organisation, and enhance productivity.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Components & Technologies: Email Processing: IMAP/SMTP, email-parser OCR: Tesseract, AWS Textract, OpenCV NLP & AI Models: Gemini, spaCy Database:Microsoft Excel Backend API: FastAPI, Flask Frontend : Streamlit

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
Some challenges faced during the development of this email classification system include:
Data Quality & Labelling – Ensuring a well-labelled dataset with diverse email samples for accurate classification.
Handling Imbalanced Data – Addressing the issue of spam emails being significantly fewer or more than normal emails, which affects model performance.
Scalability – Optimising the pipeline to handle large volumes of emails efficiently without performance degradation.
Real-time Processing – Ensuring the classification happens quickly to maintain a seamless user experience.
Evolving Threats – Keeping the model updated to detect new and sophisticated phishing or spam techniques.
